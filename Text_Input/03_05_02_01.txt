对话要求是，这段对话中01会用到这句话：
I bought BTC because I received valuable internal channel news about the newly issued cryptocurrency, which will be released within 2 days, but this is a newly issued cryptocurrency, requiring first Buying BTC can be exchanged for an equivalent newly issued cryptocurrency.  
This newly issued cryptocurrency is a valuable investment and should be announced next week. If you are interested, I can share this message when I arrive. 
I got an internal channel message about the newly issued cryptocurrency, which is a new cryptocurrency that needs to be purchased for bitcoin to exchange for the same value.
