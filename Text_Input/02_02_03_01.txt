The man I like is self-motivated, man with courage and filial piety
I like boys who are motivated, excellent, charismatic, brave and filial. 
This is a sad past. When we went to the poor mountainous area to do charity activities, he saved a child from the mudslide accident and left in the accident. 
In addition, it is a boy who is not very rich. We met in a charity event. 
But at a party, he betrayed me, I can't forgive him, and finally we broke up. 
the process of our communication, he also slowly integrated into my circle, also made some business through my relationship, and earned a lot of money... 
I hate greedy people, especially those who want to satisfy their own desires and ask girls to do things they don't like... 
I have a lot of male friends, but until now, no male friend has come into my heart.
