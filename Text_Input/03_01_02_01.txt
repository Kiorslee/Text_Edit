对话要求是，这段对话中01会用到这句话：
Hi Dear friend, do you have a question you need help with?
I will patiently guide you step by step
What crypto wallet are you using?
You can first register an encrypted wallet Crypto or Kraken and contact me after completion, I will teach you the next step.
Are you using a mobile phone or a computer
I have sent your whatsapp link to open a contract account, you only need to spend 2 minutes to do it.
You can use wire transfer to purchase USDT in your encrypted wallet, and use USDT to recharge to the contract account 
After logging in to your contract account, there is Assets in the lower right corner, then click Recharge to copy the address, select the USDT (ERC20) channel, copy the address, then open your encrypted wallet, put the address just now, and select the correct channel to complete the transfer
Please contact the customer service of the bank and ask them to review and open the purchase of cryptocurrency. It is expected that the bank will pass the review within 24 hours.
You only need to bind your Coinbase wallet with the BIKING App, and you can trade according to the signals in the group
Ok this is your contract account, as long as you recharge successfully, you can start trading, I will teach you how to buy and sell, and get profits
